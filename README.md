# Krishna does dotfiles
Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine. While [bearlike/my-popos-setup](https://github.com/bearlike/my-popos-setup) made basic setup easy, I was a little tired of having to (re)configure all my machines, VMs etc., after every minor inconvenience. After taking decent amount of inspiration from [holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), this repo was born to automate system setups.

## Getting Started

### What's Inside?
Although the repository is named dotfiles, I'll also try to include configuration/installation files that serve a similar purpose. Check them out in the file browser above and see what works for you. [Fork it](https://github.com/bearlike/dotfiles/fork), remove what you don't use, and build on what's good for you.

### Installing
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bearlike/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
```

### Would this work for me?

I want this to work for everyone; I work with both Windows and Ubuntu-based systems daily, so this repo will try accomodating both of these workspaces. But that being said, I do use this as _my_ dotfiles, so there's a solid chance I may break something if I forget to make a check for a dependency.

If you're new to the project and run into any blockers, please [open an issue](https://github.com/bearlike/dotfiles/issues) on this repository and I'd love to get it fixed for you!

### Thanks
1. A decent amount of the code in these dotfiles are inspired from [Holam's Dotfile project](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).
2. Until watching [~/.dotfiles in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_MpUP6aKiQ), I never thought of maintaining a dotfiles repo.
